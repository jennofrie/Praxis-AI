feat: add AI processing animations and enhance Reports page

### AI Processing Button Component
- Create reusable AIProcessingButton component with professional animations
- Add stage-based progress indicators showing real-time AI processing steps
- Implement visual effects: gradient glow, shimmer, floating particles, progress bar
- Support two color variants: Emerald (Section 34 Audit) and Indigo (CoC Assessment)
- Add different stage messages for audit vs. assessment workflows:
  * Audit: Scanning → Analyzing Section 34 → Evaluating evidence → 3-pass analysis → Generating report
  * CoC: Processing circumstances → Analyzing triggers → Evaluating eligibility → Determining pathway → Generating reports

### Reports & Docs Page Enhancement
- Rewrite Reports page to fetch real data from report_audits and coc_assessments tables
- Implement participant name extraction from document names with intelligent parsing
- Add participant initials display format (e.g., "J.D." instead of full names/photos)
- Rename "AI Confidence" to "Spectra Confidence" across UI
- Add "Final" status badge for completed Planner and CoC assessments
- Implement tab-based filtering: All Reports, Section 34 Audits, CoC Assessments
- Add Report Summary widget showing counts by type
- Add Recent Activity widget with time-ago formatting
- Implement search functionality across participant names and document names
- Add color-coded status indicators: Final (green), Review (yellow), Critical (red), Blocked (gray)

### Component Updates
- Update PlannerMode to use animated AIProcessingButton
- Update CoCMode to use animated AIProcessingButton
- Improve user feedback during AI processing with visual progress

### Styling & Animations
- Add custom CSS keyframe animations in globals.css:
  * shimmer: horizontal sweep animation
  * float: particle floating effect
  * pulse-ring: pulsing glow animation
  * spin-slow: slow rotation animation

### Documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md with all new features and changes
- Update SeniorPlanner_Implementation.md with current file structure
- Add AI Processing Button documentation section
- Update key files references to reflect current architecture

### Technical Improvements
- Add TypeScript null-safety checks for array access in AIProcessingButton
- Add bounds checking for stage array access
- Implement proper error handling for Supabase data fetching
